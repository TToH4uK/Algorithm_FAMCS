For the directed graph defined by the adjacency matrix, a depth search was performed. 
In case of ambiguity in the choice of the next vertex, the vertex with the lowest number was always chosen. 
In the process of searching in depth, at the time of visiting the peak, it was assigned a mark (the numbering of marks begins with one). 
Determine which label each of the vertices of the graph has received.

Input
  The first line contains an integer n vertices of the orgraph (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). 
  The vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Next, the adjacency matrix of the graph is written: n rows of n numbers, each of which is 0 or 1. 
  Numbers are separated by single spaces. It is guaranteed that all elements on the main diagonal are zero.
Output
  Output n numbers, the i-e of which is the label received by the vertex i.
