An undirected graph is given by a list of edges. Construct an adjacency matrix of this graph. It is guaranteed that there are no loops or multiples of edges in the graph.

Input
  The first line contains two integers n and m — the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the number of edges of the graph (0 ≤ m ≤ n(n − 1) / 2). 
  The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. 
  The following m lines describe the edges: in each line, two vertices you and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, with you and v different) are separated by a space, which are connected by an edge.

Output
  Output the adjacency matrix of the graph: n rows of n numbers, each number is 0 or 1, the numbers in the rows are separated by spaces.
