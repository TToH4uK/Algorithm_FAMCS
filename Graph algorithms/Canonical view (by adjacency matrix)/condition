A directed graph is specified, which is the root tree. The vertices of the graph are numbered with integers from 1 to n. 
The arcs run from the root to the leaves. Print the canonical way to specify this tree.
The canonical way to represent a root tree on n vertices is an array P of size n, where pi is the father of the vertex i, and if the vertex i is the root of the tree, then pi is assumed to be zero.

Input
  The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). In the next n rows, the adjacency matrix of the graph is specified. 
  If there is an arc in the graph leading from vertex i to vertex j, then in the i-th line of the matrix, the j-number is equal to 1, otherwise 0. 
  Numbers are separated by single spaces. It is guaranteed that the input graph is a root tree.
Output
  Output n numbers, which are the elements of the P array.
