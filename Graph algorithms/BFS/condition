For the directed graph specified by the adjacency matrix, a breadth search was performed. In case of ambiguity in the choice of the next vertex, the vertex with the lowest number was always chosen. 
In the process of searching in breadth, at the time of visiting the vertex, it was assigned a label (the numbering of labels begins with one). 
Determine which label each of the vertices in the graph received (the breadth search was performed until all vertices received labels).

Input
  The first line contains an integer n vertices of the orgraph (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). 
  The vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Next, the adjacency matrix of the graph is written: n rows of n numbers, each of which is 0 or 1. Numbers are separated by single spaces. 
  It is guaranteed that all elements on the main diagonal are zero.
Output
  Output n numbers, the i-e of which is the label received by the vertex i.
