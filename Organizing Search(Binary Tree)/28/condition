Find in the tree the average value of the vertices whose subtree heights are equal. Delete (by right deletion) the given vertex, if it exists. 
The leaves of the tree are also considered as vertices whose subtrees have equal heights.

If a vertex does not have a subtree, then its height is set to âˆ’1.

Input
  The input file contains a sequence of numbers - the keys of the vertices in the order they were added to the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has at least two vertices.
Output
  The output file must contain the sequence of vertex keys obtained by a forward left traversal of the resulting tree.
