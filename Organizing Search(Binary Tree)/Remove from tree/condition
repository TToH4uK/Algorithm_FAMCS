Based on the set of keys, build a binary search tree. Remove the key from it (by right removal) if it is in the tree. Perform a straight left traversal of the resulting tree.

Input
The first line contains an integer, which is the key that needs to be removed from the tree.
The second line is empty.
The following lines contain a sequence of numbersâ€”the vertex keys in the order in which they were added to the tree. 
Keys are specified in the format, one per line. The tree contains at least two vertices.
Recall that in the search tree, all keys are unique by definition, so if you try to add a key to the tree that is already there, it is ignored.

Output
Output the sequence of vertex keys obtained by the straight left traversal of the tree.
