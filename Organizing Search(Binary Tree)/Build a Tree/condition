Based on the set of keys, build a binary search tree and perform a direct left traversal of it.

Input
The input file contains a sequence of numbers â€” vertex keys in the order in which they were added to the tree. Keys are specified in the format, one per line.
In a search tree, all keys are unique by definition, so if you try to add a key to the tree that is already there, it is ignored.

Output
The output file must contain the sequence of vertex keys obtained by the direct left traversal of the tree.
