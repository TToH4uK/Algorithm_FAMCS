A hash table consists of m cells (cells are numbered with integers from 0 to m − 1). The open addressing method is used to resolve collisions. Function

h(x, i) = ((x mod m) + c ⋅ i) mod m
Specifies a linear sequence of free cell samples, where x is the key, i is the attempt number (attempts are numbered from zero), and c is a constant.
N keys were sequentially added to the table. If the key is already in the table, it is not added again.
Determine which key is stored in each cell in the table when all operations are completed.

Input
  In the first line, three integers are separated by a space: the size m of the table (2 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), the constant c (1 ≤ c ≤ m − 1), and the number n keys to add (0 ≤ n ≤ 10,000). 
  The number c is mutually simple with the number m. Next, the next n lines contain the keys that are added to the hash table, i.e. integers from the range from 0 to 109. 
  Keys can be repeated, but it is guaranteed that there is enough space in the table to accommodate all of the unique keys from the n given keys.
Output
  Output exactly m numbers, the i-th number describes the i-th cell (0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1). If the cell is empty, print −1, otherwise print the key it contains.
