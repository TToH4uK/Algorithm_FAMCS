Two character sequences A and B are input, each sequence is not empty, consists of small Latin letters and has a length of no more than 1000 characters. 
You must convert sequence A to sequence B with the minimum cumulative penalty, which is defined as follows:

removing the character from the line A equals x points;
inserting a character into a line A is equal to y points;
replacing a character in line A with any other one equals z points.

Input
The first three lines contain the numbers x, y, z, respectively. All numbers are integer positive and do not exceed 1,000,000.
The next two lines contain character sequences A and B (string element type).

Output
Output the minimum total penalty.
