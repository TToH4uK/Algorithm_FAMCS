Given a matrix A of natural numbers of size n × m. Each pass through element (i, j) incurs a penalty ai, j. 
It is necessary to minimize the penalty and go from element (1, 1) to (n, m), 
while from the current element you can go to any of the three neighboring ones located in the line with a number one greater (i.e. from element (i , j) you can go to one of the elements (i + 1, j − 1), (i + 1, j), (i + 1, j + 1), if they exist).

Input
  The first line contains two numbers: n and m, where n is the number of rows of matrix A, and m is the number of columns of matrix A.
  The next n lines define the matrix A itself: each line contains m integers separated by single spaces.

Limits: 2 ≤ n ≤ 200, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1 000, 0 ≤ ai, j ≤ 1 000 000.

Output
  Print one integer — the minimum cost of the path or −1 (minus one) if there is no path.
