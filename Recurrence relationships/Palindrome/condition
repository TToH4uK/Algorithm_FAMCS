Enter a non-empty string S, which is no more than 7000 characters long and consists only of lowercase Latin letters. 
You need to remove the minimum number of characters from the string so that you get a palindrome (a string of characters that reads from left to right and right to left the same way).

Input
The first line contains the original line S.
Output
Print the length of the resulting palindrome in the first line, and the palindrome itself in the second line (if there are several palindromes, print only one of them).
